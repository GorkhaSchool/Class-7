### What is a Computer Virus?

A computer virus is a type of malicious software (malware) that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs, data files, or the boot sector of the hard drive, inserting its own code. It requires a host program to run and spread, similar to a biological virus.

### How does a computer virus spread or get transmitted?

Viruses typically spread through various methods, usually requiring some form of user action to activate them. 
Common transmission methods include:
Email Attachments: Opening an infected file attached to an email.
Internet Downloads: Downloading infected programs or files from untrusted websites.
Removable Storage: Using infected USB drives or external hard drives.
Network Sharing: Sharing infected files across a network.
 
### What are some common symptoms that indicate a computer may be infected with a virus?

Symptoms can vary, but common signs of a virus infection include:
Slow Performance: A sudden and noticeable slowdown in the computer's processing speed.
Unexpected Pop-ups: Frequent, unwanted pop-up windows or advertisements appearing.
System Instability: Frequent computer crashes, freezes, or the "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD).
Unusual Activity: Automatic opening/closing of programs, unauthorized file access, or strange messages.
Loss of Files/Space: Files suddenly disappearing or running out of storage space due to the virus replicating itself.

### What are the best ways to protect a computer system from viruses?

The best protection involves a multi-layered approach:

- Install and Update Antivirus Software: Use reputable antivirus/anti-malware software and keep it updated to detect and remove threats.

- Keep Software Updated: Regularly update your operating system (Windows, macOS, etc.) and applications. Developers frequently release patches to fix security vulnerabilities that viruses exploit.

- Be Cautious with Emails and Downloads: Never open email attachments or click links from unknown or suspicious senders. Only download software from official, trusted sources.

- Regular Data Backup: Back up important files regularly to an external or cloud storage service so data can be restored if the system is compromised.
